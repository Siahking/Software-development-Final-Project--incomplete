# OVERVIEW

## Purpose  
At my workplace, roster creation has consistently faced challenges. Workers were often scheduled on days they had requested off, shifts frequently overlapped- resulting in overstaffing at some locations or assigning the same person to multiple locations on the same day. Additionally, rosters were often released late due to managerial workload, disrupting employeesâ€™ personal plans. To address this, I built a system to manage workers, locations, constraints and availability, and to automatically generate accurate rosters, minimisng human error and improving scheduling efficiency.

## Project Overview  
OPTIROSTER is a full stack project developed entirely from scratch.It utilises CRUD API requests to manage and store data related to workers, locations, days off, worker constraints, permanent restrictions, and occupancies in a MySQL database. This data is then compiled to automatically generate rosters that assign workers to shifts while honoring their availability and restrictions.

## Technologies Used  
 - Frontend:        HTML, CSS,Vanilla Javascript
 - Backend:         Go(Golang)
 - Database:        MySQL
 - APIS:            Custom REST API
 - Architecture:    MVC inspired project structure

## Key Features  
 - Create update and delete workers and locations
 - Define days off, availably constraints and permanent time restrictions
 - Automatically generates rosters that:
   - assign workers to shifts
   - respect all defined unavailability rules
   - detect and alert insufficient staffing 
 - dynamic frontend with real-time user feedback
 - Modular well organize codebase with clear separation of concerns

## Directory Structure  
 - **Css**
   Contains all stylesheets, including a main file for shared styles across all pages.

 - **Database**	
   Includes the database schema used to define and structure data.

 - **HTML**
   Contains all HTML templates for rendering the user interface

 - **Models**
   Contains backend logic for database access and route definitions

 - **Views**		
   Handles all data processing logic and client data delivery. Includes shared helper utilities and feature-specific view logic.

 - **Main.go**
   The entry point for compiling and launching the backend server.

## Views
 - **Backend**	
   Connects the client to the backend endpoints and performs error checking proper CRUD operations.

 - **General helper funcs**	
   Shared utility functions shared across multiple view modules.

 - **Subdirectories in views**
   Each feature based subdirectory (e.g workers, locations, etc) includes:

   - main.js		
	Sets up event listeners for UI interactions like button clicks and form submissions.

   - frontend.js
    Manages UI behaviour, such as showing/hiding elements or updating content dynamically.

   - functions.js
    Handles backend logic, including API communication and error handling.

 - **Roster module(example)**
   - functions.js
    Processes data from the backend and implements roster assignment logic

   - frontend.js
    Displays the calendar interface and populates it with shift data.

## Webpages
 - **Create Roster**
   Allows the user to select a future month, year, and location to dynamically generate a roster.

 - **Workers**
   Displays all workers stored in the database,including their assigned locations.
   Features:
    - Add Worker
        - Inputs:First name *(required)*, Middle Name, Last Name *(required)*,     Gender, Address *(required)*, Age *(required)*, Contact, ID Number *(required)*, Availability *(required)*,Assigned Locations *(required)*
        - Creates a new worker entry.
    - Find Worker
        - Search by ID, ID Number, First Name, Last Name, or Middle Name

 - **Locations**
   Displays all stored locations.
   Features:
    - Add Location
        - Inputs:Location Name
        - Creates a new location
    - Find Location
        - Search by location name

 - **Constraints**
   Displays all stored worker constraints.
   Features:
    - Add Constraint
        - Inputs: Worker 1 ID *(required)*, Worker 2 ID *(required)*, Summary
        - Creates a new constraint indicating why the two workers shouldn't be scheduled together.
    - Find Constraint
        - Search using first/last name of Worker 1 and/or Worker 2
    - Edit Constraint
        - Inputs: Constraint ID, fields to be updated (Worker 1 ID, Worker 2 ID, or Summary)

 - **Days Off & Restrictions**
   Displays both temporary and permanent days off.
   Features:
    - Add Days Off
        - Inputs: Worker ID, Start Date, End Date
        - Creates a temporary day-off record
    - Find Days Off
        - Search by Worker ID or Break ID
    - Add Restriction
        - Inputs: Worker ID, Day of Week, (Optional) Start Time, End Time
        - Creates a permanent restriction
    - Find Restriction
        - Search by restriction ID or Worker ID.
